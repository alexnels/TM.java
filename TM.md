This week, after reviewing the code and possible solution presented by professor Posnett, I decided against reworking my solution. Overall it would be much easier to implement this weeks required changes to my own implementation rather than to rewrite my program. 

My program contains only two classes, the TM and log classes. I decided to add support for the 'T-Shirt' program sizes by adding a new command rather than adding a new argument to the end of a programs description. This decision simply allowed me to add another case to my case statement and change a few lines of my summary function to support the new line of output. 

As far as supporting the multiple lines of description for any given tracked program, I was able to only edit a few lines of my readEntry() function to append the multiple description strings together to form a single line of output. Overall although my code might not be the most efficient or clean solution I was pleased with my ability to finish this weeks sprint within about 30 minutes of starting working on it.
